# UVTestLab

UVTestLab is an open source collection of data containing testing of UV LEDs, bandpass filters, and dichroic filters. It was created to improve the development of consumer devices in the UV LED space with a secondary purpose of combating dubious data and claims in the UVC (sometimes called germicidal) LED space.

## Contents

This repo currently contains the following directories:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Dichroic Testing | Testing [solarization rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarization_(physics)) of various dichroic filters when put under UVC wavelengths. |

### Planned Content
- LED Testing
- Bandpass Filter Testing
- Data visualization (graphs/charts/etc) for 100 hour dichroic test
